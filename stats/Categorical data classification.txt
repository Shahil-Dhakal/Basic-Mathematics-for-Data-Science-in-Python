In statistics, nominal and ordinal data are two types of categorical data:

Nominal Data:

Definition: Nominal data are categories with no specific order. They're just names or labels that help to differentiate between different items.
Example: Colors (red, blue, green), types of fruit (apple, banana, cherry), or gender (male, female).
Ordinal Data:

Definition: Ordinal data are categories that have a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between the ranks are not necessarily equal.
Example: Customer satisfaction levels (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied), education levels (high school, bachelor's, master's), or rankings in a competition (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
In short:

Nominal = Categories with no order.
Ordinal = Categories with a specific order.
